# Tutedude Python Assignment 3 â€“ Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository includes the Python scripts completed for **Assignment 3** of the **Tutedude Python Programming Course**, based on **Module 4: Functions and Modules in Python**. This module focuses on enhancing code modularity and reusability through user-defined functions and the use of built-in Python modules.

The assignment comprises two tasks. **Task 1** is centered on function creation and implementation. In this task, a Python function named `factorial` is defined, which takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial either using a loop or recursion. The function then returns the computed factorial. To demonstrate functionality, the script calls the `factorial()` function with a sample input and displays the output. This task helps reinforce the concepts of defining functions, parameter passing, return statements, and basic algorithmic thinking.

**Task 2** focuses on utilizing Python's built-in `math` module to perform various mathematical operations. The program begins by asking the user for a number as input. It then calculates and displays the square root, natural logarithm (base e), and sine of the number using relevant functions from the `math` module. This task encourages learners to explore standard modules, understand function documentation, and apply them effectively in real-world calculations.

Both scripts are developed using Python 3 and written in a clean, readable manner to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. Proper validations and error handling are included where applicable, especially for operations such as logarithmic computation (which may not work for non-positive numbers). These programs not only demonstrate core Python concepts but also show how to break problems into smaller, manageable components using functions and modules.

To run the programs, simply clone the repository and execute the `.py` files using any Python 3 interpreter. This assignment highlights the importance of structuring code efficiently and introduces learners to the power of modular programming in Python.
